# GravityPlayground

Created for Swift Playgrounds 3.3 for iPad, in Xcode 11.4.1 on Mac.

Apple's SpriteKit has a physics engine that includes a gravity simulation.
This Swift playground attempts to leverage it to teach users a bit about
gravity from a physics perspective by challenging them to put satellites in
orbit around planets to create their own solar system.
